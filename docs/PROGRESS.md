# Progress Log

> **New session?** Read these first, in order: `docs/BRIEF.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, this file, then run `git status`. Continue from **Next step** below.

_Last updated: Sep 27, 2026_

## Current phase

**Phase 0: Plan.** `docs/PLAN.md` is written and waiting for the user's **"go"**. Saying "go" also accepts the recommended default for every decision (D1–D8) in PLAN.md §2 unless the user changes one.

## Next step

After "go": announce **Phase 1: Foundation** with `⚙️ Normal effort is fine for this phase`, wait for "ready", then start step 1.1.

## Done

- [x] Git set up inside `cow-app` and connected to GitHub: `bhuvanagiridevarsh-source/cow-app` (public, `main` branch).
- [x] Brief saved as `docs/BRIEF.md`.
- [x] Website snapshot saved in `reference/website-home.html`. Its photos are embedded in the file.
- [x] Lamp logo from the website saved as `assets/brand/cow-logo-256.png`. It's only 256 px; a higher-res version is needed later.
- [x] Research for the plan:
  - Expo Go / SDK 57 library support
  - Supabase auth, storage, and free-plan limits
  - brand colors taken from the site's stylesheet
- [x] `docs/PLAN.md` written.

## Facts found during research (keep in mind)

- **Libraries and Expo Go**
  - `lottie-react-native` is NOT in Expo Go on SDK 57.
  - `expo-haptics` isn't listed as included in Expo Go in the SDK 57 docs. Test it on the phone in Phase 1.
- **Testing setup**
  - This Mac has **no Xcode**, so there's no iOS simulator; phone checks are done by the user on their iPhone.
  - Expo Go on a real iPhone requires Expo Go and the Expo CLI to be signed in to the same Expo account. The CLI is currently **not logged in**.
- **Supabase**
  - The built-in email only sends to members of the Supabase team, with a low hourly limit. Real email sending (SMTP) is required before launch.
  - Sign in with Apple in Expo Go needs `host.exp.Exponent` added to the Apple provider's Client IDs in Supabase.
  - Supabase now calls the anon key the "publishable key" (`sb_publishable_…`). Either works.
  - Storage files must be deleted through the Storage API, not SQL.
  - Free projects pause after 7 days of low activity (restorable for 90 days).
  - The user's existing Supabase org "Blogs" has 3 projects, all paused. None of them are for CoW.
- **Expo location:** on Android, `geocodeAsync` needs location permission. That's why the ZIP-centroid fallback exists.

## Waiting on (not blocking yet)

- [ ] High-res logo, 1024×1024+ (needed in Phase 9)
- [ ] Zeffy donation URL (Donate buttons stay hidden until then)
- [ ] `reference/app-plan.html` (optional)
- [ ] Who manages the childrenofwarproject.org domain? Needed for real email sending before launch.
- [ ] Privacy Policy / Terms URLs, once posted on the website
- [ ] Apple Developer + Google Play organization enrollment (long lead time; see PLAN.md §12)
